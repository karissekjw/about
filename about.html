<h3>Hi there, I'm Karisse Khoo :wave:</h3>

<p>
  :girl: I'm an Information Systems (IS) undergraduate at Singapore Management University who found my passion for developing
  applications that can provide utility to people while working as a Web Developer for my first internship during my Polytechnic days.

<p>
  :bulb: Knowledge is wealth. As an independent learner, I read an abundant of tech articles and I hope by starting 
  a tech blog, like-minded individuals can learn more too!
</p>

<p>
  :speaker: Through the 5 years of coding experience, I began to become a strong advocate for clean codes for code maintainability.

<p>
  :star: Started as a web developer that builds interactive webpages using <b>HTML</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>S(CSS)</b>.
  Currently, picking up <b>ReactJS</b> as my frontend framework, <b>Express.js</b> as my backend framework to build APIs and
  <b>MongoDB</b> for NoSQL database.

<p>
  :heart: Love a good TV series with strong character development. Also, pretty much a dog-lover.
